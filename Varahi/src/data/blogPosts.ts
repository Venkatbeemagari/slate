      <h2>Understanding the Seasons</h2>
      <p>The temples of Kedarnath and Badrinath are open for only six months a year, typically from April/May to October/November. This is due to extreme weather conditions during winter months.</p>

      <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
      <p>The ideal time to visit Kedarnath and Badrinath is during May-June or September-October. These months offer stable weather conditions and clear skies, perfect for both darshan and sightseeing.</p>

      <h2>Essential Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Book your accommodation well in advance during peak season</li>
        <li>Carry appropriate clothing for varying temperatures</li>
        <li>Check weather forecasts before planning your journey</li>
